# Getting started

Note:
  To use this you have to have already setup the `.env` in the top level directory of this
  project by replacing the placeholder values with values for your environment.

To prepare an environment for this first create a Python 3.9 >= virtual environment using your
choice of libraries then activate the environment and ensure pip is installed then run
`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary environments.

Then to initiate a server service instance make sure you have the created virtual environment
activated before running `python .\message_service\main.py`.
